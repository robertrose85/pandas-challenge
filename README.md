# PyCity Schools Analysis

#### Our analysis takes two data sets, school data and student data, combines them and provides us with performance details of each student in each school. With this data we are able to see that Charter schools tend to have better student math and reading averages than district schools (Charter schools dominate the top 5 spots of the high performing schools list. District schools populate the bottom 5). There might be a few factors that play into this:

* Charter schools appear to have a lower student population and there is a correlation between higher score averages and lower student populations.
* There does not seem to be a correlation that ties increased funding to increased student performance. Charter schools overall have less funding per student and still perform better.
